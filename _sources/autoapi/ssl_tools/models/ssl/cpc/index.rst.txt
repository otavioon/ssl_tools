.. py:class:: CPC(encoder, density_estimator, auto_regressor, lr = 0.001, weight_decay = 0.0, window_size = 4, n_size = 5)


   Bases: :py:obj:`lightning.LightningModule`, :py:obj:`ssl_tools.utils.configurable.Configurable`

   Implements the Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) model, as described in
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748. The implementation was adapted from
   https://github.com/sanatonek/TNC_representation_learning

   The model is trained to predict the future representation of a window of
   samples, given the past representation of the same window. The model is
   trained to maximize the mutual information between the past and future
   representations. The model is trained using a contrastive loss, where the
   positive samples are the future representations of the same window, and the
   negative samples are the future representations of other windows.

   Implements the Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) model.

   Parameters
   ----------
   encoder : torch.nn.Module
       Model that encodes a window of samples into a representation.
       This model takes the sample windows as input and outputs a
       representation of the windows (Z-vector). Original paper uses a
       GRU+Linear.
   density_estimator : torch.nn.Module
       Model that estimates the density of a representation.
   auto_regressor : torch.nn.Module
       Model that predicts the future representation of a window of
       samples, given the past representation of the same window.
   lr : float, optional
       Learning rate, by default 1e-3.
   weight_decay : float, optional
       Weight decay, by default 0.0
   window_size : int, optional
       Size of the input windows (X_t) to be fed to the encoder
   n_size : int, optional
       Number of negative samples to be used in the contrastive loss
       (steps to predict)

   .. py:method:: _shared_step(batch, batch_idx, prefix)


   .. py:method:: _step(sample)

      Perform a forward pass through the model.

      Parameters
      ----------
      sample : torch.Tensor
          A tensor of shape (B, C, T), where B is the batch size, C is the
          number of channels and T is the number of time steps. Note that T
          may vary between samples of the dataset. If this is the case, the
          B dimension must be 1.

      Returns
      -------
      torch.Tensor
          A tensor of size (B, encoder_output_size), with the samples encoded


   .. py:method:: configure_optimizers()


   .. py:method:: forward(sample)

      Perform a forward pass through the model. This method is used to
      encode a sample into a representation.

      Parameters
      ----------
      sample : torch.Tensor
          The sample to be encoded. A tensor of shape (B, C, T), where B is
          the batch size, C is the number of channels and T is the number of
          time steps.

      Returns
      -------
      torch.Tensor
          A tensor of size (B, encoder_output_size), with the samples encoded.

   .. py:method:: loss_function(X_N, labels)

.. py:function:: build_cpc(encoding_size = 150, in_channel = 6, gru_hidden_size = 100, gru_num_layers = 1, gru_bidirectional = True, dropout = 0.0, learning_rate = 0.001, weight_decay = 0.0, window_size = 4, n_size = 5)

   Builds a default CPC model. This function aid in the creation of a CPC
   model, by setting the default values of the parameters.

   Parameters
   ----------
   encoding_size : int, optional
       Size of the encoding (output of the linear layer). This is the size of
       the representation.
   in_channel : int, optional
       Number of input features (e.g. 6 for HAR data in MotionSense Dataset)
   gru_hidden_size : int, optional
       The number of features in the hidden state of the GRU.
   gru_num_layers : int, optional
       Number of recurrent layers in the GRU. E.g., setting ``num_layers=2``
       would mean stacking two GRUs together to form a `stacked GRU`,
       with the second GRU taking in outputs of the first GRU and
       computing the final results.
   gru_bidirectional : bool, optional
       If ``True``, becomes a bidirectional GRU.
   dropout : float, optional
       The dropout probability.
   learning_rate : float, optional
       The learning rate of the optimizer.
   weight_decay : float, optional
       The weight decay of the optimizer.
   window_size : int, optional
       Size of the input windows (X_t) to be fed to the encoder
   n_size : int, optional
       Number of negative samples to be used in the contrastive loss
       (steps to predict)

   Returns
   -------
   CPC
       The CPC model
