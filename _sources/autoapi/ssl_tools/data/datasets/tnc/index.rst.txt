.. py:class:: TNCDataset(data, window_size, mc_sample_size = 20, significance_level = 0.01, repeat = 1, cast_to = 'float32')


   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.utils.data.Dataset`

   
   Temporal Neighbourhood Coding (TNC) dataset. This dataset is used
   to pre-train self-supervised models. The dataset obtain close and
   distant samples from a time series.

   The dataset returns a 3-element tuple with the following elements:
   1. W_t, a window centered at random time step t, with window_size. It
       is a numpy array with shape (n_features, window_size).
   2. X_p, a set of close samples. It is a numpy array with shape
       (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size).
   3. X_n, a set of distant samples. It is a numpy array with shape
       (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size).
   Note that the number of distant samples may be less than mc_sample_size.

   Parameters
   ----------
   data : Dataset
       A dataset with samples. Each sample of the dataset must be a numpy
       array of shape (n_features, time_steps). In the case of HAR, where
       we have tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope data, the shape of
       each sample should be (6, time_steps). the time_steps may vary
   window_size : int
       Size of the window (δ). The window will be centered at t, with 
       window_size / 2 elements before and after t (X[t - δ, t + δ]])
   mc_sample_size : int
       The number of close and distant samples to be selected. This is
       the maximum number of samples that will be selected.
   significance_level: float, optional
       The significance level of the ADF test. It is used to reject the
       null hypothesis of the test if p-value is less than this value, by  
       default 0.01
   repeat : int, optional
       Simple repeat the element of the dataset ``repeat`` times
   cast_to : str, optional
       Cast the data to the given type, by default "float32"

   .. py:method:: __getitem__(idx)

      Get a sample from the dataset. The sample is a tuple with 3
      elements, to know:
      1. W_t, a window centered at random time step t, with window_size. It
          is a numpy array with shape (n_features, window_size).
      2. X_p, a set of close samples. It is a numpy array with shape
          (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size).
      3. X_n, a set of distant samples. It is a numpy array with shape
          (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size).
      Note that the number of distant samples may be less than mc_sample_size.

      Parameters
      ----------
      idx : int
          Index of the sample to select the close and distant samples.

      Returns
      -------
      Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
          A tuple with 3 elements (W_t, X_p, X_n).


   .. py:method:: __len__()


   .. py:method:: _find_neighours(data, t)

      Given a time series ``x_t`` and a time step ``t``, find the close
      samples and the delta. The close samples are selected using the ADF
      test. The delta adjusts the neighbourhood size.

      Parameters
      ----------
      data : np.ndarray
          The time series
      t : int
          The time step to find the close samples

      Returns
      -------
      Tuple[np.ndarray, float]
          A 2-element tuple. The first element is a numpy array with the
          shape (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size). The second element
          is the delta, used to adjust the neighbourhood size.


   .. py:method:: _find_non_neighours(data, t, delta = 0.0)

      Find distant samples. The samples will be selected from the
      neighbourhood of ``t``. If ``t`` is a time stemp from the first half
      of the time series, the neighbourhood will be the second half of the
      time series. Otherwise, the neighbourhood will be the first half of
      the time series.

      Parameters
      ----------
      data : np.ndarray
          The time series
      t : int
          The time step to find the close samples
      delta : float, optional
          Factor used to adjust the neighbourhood size, by default 0.0

      Returns
      -------
      np.ndarray
          An array with the distant samples. The shape of the array is
          (mc_sample_size, n_features, window_size). Note that if the list
          of distant samples is empty, mc_sample_size will be 1.
